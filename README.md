Earlier in the semester we considered a recurrence integral and developed a code for it. Unfortunately, the program failed by calculating In for small n correctly but producing meaningless results around 18. 

This program is a solution to the recurrence integral. It now produces accurate results for any n. It is shown by outputting the results for n from 1 and 100. It also compares the performance. It compares the accuracy between the two as well as time for the algorithms to run.
